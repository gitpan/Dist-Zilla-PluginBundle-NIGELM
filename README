NAME
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::NIGELM - Build your distributions like FLORA
    does with NIGELM tweaks

SYNOPSIS
    In dist.ini:

      [@NIGELM]
      dist = Distribution-Name
      repository_at = github

DESCRIPTION
    This is the Dist::Zilla configuration I use to build my distributions.
    It is strongly based on the @FLORA bundle, and extends that bundle (so
    if that bundle is changed incompatibly I get to keep both pieces)

    It is roughly equivalent to:

      [@Filter]
      bundle = @Basic
      remove = Readme

      [NoTabsTests]
      [EOLTests]
      [ReadmeFromPod]
      [PodCoverageTests]

      [MetaResources]
      repository.type   = git
      repository.url    = git://github.com/nigelm/${lowercase_dist}
      repository.web    = http://github.com/nigelm/${lowercase_dist}
      bugtracker.web    = http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=${dist}
      bugtracker.mailto = bug-${dist}@rt.cpan.org
      homepage          = http://search.cpan.org/dist/${dist}

      [Authority]
      authority   = cpan:NIGELM
      do_metadata = 1

      [@Git]

      [PodWeaver]
      config_plugin = @FLORA

      [AutoPrereqs]

    If "no_cpan" or the environment variable "NO_CPAN" is set, then the
    upload to CPAN is suppressed.
